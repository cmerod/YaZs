# YaZs
School project, creating a multiplayer game


The task was given at the end of the first year of my education at KTH.

The requirements was to create a multiplayer computer game that implemented either TCP or UDP.
A team of six students used C with the SDL library to create the game in less than three moenths.

The result was YaZs or Yes another Zombie shooter. A 2d top down zombie horde survival. 
Up to four players are tasked with surviving hordes of zombies for a set amount of time. 
The players have a close combat weapon and a limited supply of hitpoints. Surviving the horde 
moves the players to the next map.
